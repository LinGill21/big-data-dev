## Currrent: I am currently a senior at Northwest finshing my batchlor of science in computer science.

## Background: I am from St. Louis MO. Been at Northwest all four years of my degree. My hobbies include watching animcated dc superhero movies not the DC CW shows. My other hobby is music i play the clairent and the viloa. I use to be in the Bearcat Marching band till i realized that memorizing music is hard.

## Plans: I'm hoping to land a job doing software development in either Kansas City or back home in St Louis. I hope the job I land will allow me to try out other fields because you never know what you will love or hate until you try it.
